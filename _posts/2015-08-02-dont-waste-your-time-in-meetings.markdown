If you are working in a corporate environment, you are probably dragged into many meetings. Not just a few, more like it's actually your job to organise and attend meetings. But it's not. Your job is to get stuff done and most meetings are a waste of time.

Ever since I moved to the [Little Red Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_red_dot), things got worse. People seem to measure their importance by how crowded their Outlook Calendar is. Things got so bad that I decided to follow Google's approach of blocking every Thursday in my Outlook. No meetings allowed. Only work. It doesn't work all the time, but often enough. And since Friday is my team's Scrum Review, it gives me the necessary productive time I need to finish up things.

Despite my "no-meetings day", the normal workday is usually fragmented into hourly blocks. One hour of work here, then a meeting there, barely an hour to work, and then a meeting again. Such days suck you dry. You don't feel productive (because you aren't) and it doesn't make you happy. You want to be in [the zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) and do your work.

Change it. I know, corporate environments are almost impossible to change, but you can at least try.

## Do you have to meet?

Ask yourself: is it necessary to meet? Is your project bursting into flames without this meeting?

If yes, then go ahead. If the answer is no, then choose other ways of communication. Kicking off a discussion via a mailing list or any other collaboration platform is a good way to enhance the communication because it's asynchronous. This way of communication is open, persistent, and transparent and people are able to follow the conversation on their own schedule.

If it's more like a "status update" kind of a meeting, then write a concise post about it and share it with your audience. It's up to you to find the best alternate way, but please don't choose email.

## Have a plan

"Well, this was a waste of time."

I think this pretty often, mainly because far too many meetings don't know what they want to achieve. Write down why you meet and what the goal of the meeting is. Do yourself a favour and share this with people before you meet! They probably have an opinion and you don't want to discuss the agenda for half an hour when you actually have the meeting.

It seems common sense but make sure your plan is "[smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)". "I just want to discuss this topic with you" is not a smart plan. It's not even a plan.

## Reduce the number of participants

If your goal is to solve a problem and you have more people in the room than a Scrum team, you probably won't reach any sane consensus.
Choose your participants carefully. Don't invite colleagues:

- who are not knowledgeable about the topic and able to contribute
- who have no stake in the outcome of the meeting
- who are not respected enough among their peers to make a decision

Keep your group small. Unless you want to have a big brainstorming session to iterate over some new ideas. Then it's ok to invite more people.

## Stick to the plan

My favourite. Most people fail to stay on track. For various reason, you can probably write a book about it. Or two.

Don't bore people to death with a PowerPoint marathon. Get their attention and let them contribute within the first 10 minutes. Make sure everyone is talking - especially the quiet ones. Restrict the talkers from running in circles. Control your more dominant peers by summarising their perspective and asking others for their feedback. Have one conversation at the time. Everyone must take a stand to make a decision.

If your meeting is longer than 60 minutes, take a break.

## No laptops and smartphones

One of the major rules from my German teams. If you attend a meeting, then don't check for emails or play Candy Crush. It's not only disrespectful, it's also inefficient. When the majority is playing with their phones, it's hard to stay on track and reach a constructive consensus.

I admit that there is a cultural component to it. Apparently, people in South East Asia love their devices too much.

## Take notes

I forget stuff quickly. Almost instantly. This is the reason why I carry a paper notebook with me all the time. To take meeting minutes and to share them is important, because one or two days later we probably have forgotten the little details of a potentially big decision.

I know some teams who have shared OneNote notebooks for their entire project management. Others are using wikis or similar systems. Whatever works for you. But please don't use email.

## Summarise and take action

How often have you attended a meeting where you agreed on grand plans and then nothing happened?

Note down all points you have discussed at the end of the meeting. Define action items with deadlines and assign them. Repetition will deepen the consensus you have reached during the meeting. The tricky part: to follow up on these action items.

## Decline meeting requests

The best way to stay productive is to reduce the number of meetings. Upcoming Scrum Reviews are a good reason to decline meeting requests. Or do you have the feeling that you can't contribute to the meeting because you're not familiar with the topic? Press "decline" now!

Have the confidence to decline meeting requests if appropriate. Chances are that you won't miss anything important. No one ever went out of a meeting saying "This was the best meeting in the world! Thank God that I didn't miss it!".
